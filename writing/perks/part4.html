	<h1>Part 4</h1>
<p><The Operator and Ahhhhhhh both get out></p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: QUICKLY WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO DEMOBILIZE HYPIXIR!</p>
<p>Operator: Is that the right word? And Uhixir of course.</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: IT DOESN'T MATTER. Wait I have the schema for the gun, we can put money in it and shoot it at ourselves and make a wall.</p>
<p>Operator: That works, do you need material?</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: Yes, I have the money though-</p>
<p><Uhixir comes></p>
<p>Uhixir: UHHAHAHHAHAHAH!</p>
<p><Ahhhhhhh slaps $30k at Uhixir></p>
<p><Uhixir's elixir depletes and Uhixir turns to Uhhhhhhh></p>
<p>Uhhhhhhh: Uh, what just happe-Brother!</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: You're back-So wait, we don't need money guns to shoot money?</p>
<p>Uhhhhhhh: Uh, what?</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: No time for that, we must go purchase some things...</p>
<p>Operator: I know of a place.</p>
<p><at a nearby tavern></p>
<p>Tavernkeeper: That's a lot of concrete and guns, suspicious but here you go. Total $500k.</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: Thank you.</p>
<p>Tavernkeeper: No problem.</p>
<p>Operator: Hey, ahhh, what do you do with this?-</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: I'll show you.</p>
<p><back at the perk renewal machine></p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: Okay, this should be done. So we are prktected by these concrete walls and have these money guns to convert any elixired people back to normal.</p>
<p>Operator: A great plan!</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: But this is only temporary of course.</p>
<p><at the public floor></p>
<p>Hypixir: All 'ixirs line up!</p>
<p>Everyixir: Here we are!</p>
<p>Hypixir: Grea-Wait, where's Uhixir?</p>
<p>Everyixir: Uhhhh, we don't know.</p>
<p>Hypixir: OHHHHH NOOOO! GOOOGLGOGOGO!</p>
<p>Everyixir: Uh what-</p>
<p>Hypixir: FIIIIIIND THEIXIR!</p>
<p><back at the perk renewal machine></p>
<p><all 'ixirs come and start shooting, the guns get knocked off></p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: Oh no, this isn't working, they're RAIDING!</p>
<p>Operator: ESCAPE!</p>
<p>Uhhhhhhh: UH, SHOOT!</p>
<p><just as the concrete falls they all get teleported></p>
<p>Everyone: WHERE ARE WE?</p>
<p>Marga o Gerry: I am the magician.</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: You brought us here? Why you're helping us?</p>
<p>Operator: Wait, I know-</p>
<p>Marga o Gerry: Look, I know of the elixir, many generations ago it was made by an evil witch, and the entire multiverse was at stake, leading to the first and second elixir wars. It was then stored in a secret vault at the absolute bottom of the interdi-</p>
<p>Uhhhhhhh: Uh, sorry for interrupting but I... I... Was looking for an anecdote for Hyper and looked at this strange vau-</p>
<p>Marga o Gerry: ...</p>
<p>Operator: I thought I placed a passcode on all the vaults.</p>
<p>Marga o Gerry: ...Look, we can get to that later, but this elixir is dangerous, it took my daughter, Ness o Gerry-</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: AH! That's why you're helping us, you have a personal stake in this, ah.</p>
<p><Marga freezes everyone in place></p>
<p>Marga o Gerry: ENOUGH! Look, there are seven cures spread across the multiverse. We must find them.</p>
<p><back at the void></p>
<p>Matthew: Are we done... yet?</p>
<p>John: Yes-I think so.</p>
<p>Matthew: Seriously? We have over 30B now-</p>
<p>Other person: ...Oh my god, Mat...</p>
<p>Matthew: ... Juliet...</p>
<p>Juliet: You-</p>
<p>John: Wait, I remember you both were married once?</p>
<p>Matthew: ...</p>
<p>Juliet: You took the newspaper?</p>
<p>Matthew: Yes and I now have enough points to end you finally, I have this "megaexplosion" technique which takes 20B points, but I could never test it...</p>
<p>Juliet: I made that newspaper.</p>
<p>John: Wait, what?</p>
<p>Juliet: I also discovered the infinite point machine technique originally, I knew it was too dangerous so I destroyed everything and hid the money in some scrap, and placed it at a random place, hoping it would reach no one ever again... I was wrong clearly.</p>
<p>Matthew: ...ENOUGJH!</p>
<p><Matthew using all the points creates a giant fireball and throws it at Juliet... And there's smoke.. but Juliet creates a money wall></p>
<p>Matthew: Wait I thought you needed a gun to do that?</p>
<p>Juliet: Silly, what? You can weaponize money just fine with bare hands, just takes practice which I have done a lot of since I was exploded by John. But let's cut to the chase already-</p>
<p><Juliet using all her money creates a giant beam of money and explodes it throughout the entire void and beyond></p>
<p><back at Marga's place></p>
<p><a beam of green light passes throughout the sky></p>
<p>Operator: Oh my god, that couldn't be good-</p>
<p>Marga o Gerry: THE CURE!</p>
<p>Everyone: WAIT, WHAT?</p>
<p>Marga o Gerry: The first cure of generosity, it must be that!</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: ...</p>
<p>Uhhhhhhh: Uh, how do you think that beam of light has anything to do with generosity except color perhaps?</p>
<p>Marga o Gerry: it's "colour", and let's-</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: Very petty for someone who wants to cut to the real things-</p>
<p>Marga o Gerry: YOU ALL ARE ANNOYING! Focus! We need to go to that place, wherever it is. Operator, can you do anything?</p>
<p>Operator: Uhhh, well I control interdimensional travel afterall so yeah.</p>
<p><After some travelling, everyone arrives at that llace in the void></p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: I doubt that this cure is located in the</p>
<p>voi-</p>
<p><Matthew and Juliet are firing at each other></p>
<p>John: CALM DOWN!!!! Mat, we cannot conquer the universe with all this fighting!</p>
<p>Marga o Gerry: Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Matthew: ...</p>
<p>Juliet: You guys are on my side, just to make everything clear, right?</p>
<p>Uhhhhhhh: Uhh.....</p>
<p>John: This is clearly going to be an.. Epic. Showdown.</p>
