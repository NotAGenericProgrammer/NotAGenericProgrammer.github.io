	<h1>Part 3</h1>
<p><John and Hyper arrive at the public floor></p>
<p>John: Oh no, I am stupid.</p>
<p>Hyper: YOUUUUU!</p>
<p><Hyper launches $1k gun></p>
<p><John freezes></p>
<p>Hyper: Th@t's beautiful.</p>
<p>TBeautiful: Why am I being invited? I need to bring make-OH, NO IS THAT.</p>
<p><Operator comes in></p>
<p><Operator kicks TBeautiful></p>
<p>Operator: Woah, John's gotten frozen!</p>
<p>Hyper: YEEEEEAH!</p>
<p>Operator: You technically committed a crime but you know it's fi-</p>
<p>Matthew: Now, Hyper, I can finally explode you!</p>
<p><Matthew freezes Hyper></p>
<p>Matthew: Damn it, wrong move.</p>
<p>Operator: HEY! Who do you think you are to do that!</p>
<p>Matthew: It was JUSTIFIED!</p>
<p>Operator: Nuh uh.</p>
<p><Operator kicks Matthew></p>
<p><In the void></p>
<p>Matthew: Ugh, that stupid operator, I need to survive on junk now.</p>
<p><Matthew picks up a newspaper></p>
<p>Matthew: Hmmm-Wait this isn't a newspaper, it contains... dollars? Uh, $100k.</p>
<p><+$100k to Matthew></p>
<p>Matthew: Well, maybe I can buy points and lay off the loan and make the operator happy! Just need to search for an ATM.</p>
<p><Back at the public floor></p>
<p>Operator: I need to get Operator 2 back, maybe John can help on that, but Hyper froze John! I need Hyper back!</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhh: I thought I'd help-Wait Hyper's frozen! NOOOOOOOOOO!</p>
<p>Uhhhhhhh: Uh, I think we can unfreeze them using this elixir.</p>
<p><Uhhhhhhh takes out elixir></p>
<p>Operator: I don't trust that but try.</p>
<p><Uhhhhhhh places elixir on Hyper></p>
<p>Hypixir: I am back!</p>
<p>Uhhhhhhh: Wait, you aren't Hyper-</p>
<p><Hypixir takes money guns and elixizes it and shoots elixir></p>
<p><Uhhhhhhh turns Uhixir></p>
<p>Operator: RUNNNN!</p>
<p><Operator and Ahhhhhhh both run></p>
<p><Back at the void></p>
<p>John: Ugh, this is terrible.</p>
<p>Matthew: So, there you are.</p>
<p>John: Mat?</p>
<p>Matthew: I had a suspicion it was you. Haven't met in decades, how things been going bro?</p>
<p>John: No time for that... You have money?</p>
<p>Matthew: Yeah? Want some?</p>
<p><John uses 25M points to create an ATM></p>
<p><Matthew puts $50k and gets out 2.5M points></p>
<p>Matthew: The exchange rate is low.</p>
<p>John: Damn it, maybe we can switch to a different provider...</p>
<p>Matthew: EzPoints seem good, only $1 for 1,000 points.</p>
<p>John: Let's try this.</p>
<p><John puts the rest $50k and gets 50M points></p>
<p>John: Well, I got double at least.</p>
<p>Matthew: You? You mean us, right?</p>
<p>John: Oh, yeah yeah. Now what I am thinking is see this.</p>
<p><John vaporizes the ATM for $25k></p>
<p><John makes a new ATM using 25M more points></p>
<p>Matthew: Wait, we can put that in for more... And get more... And this is an infinite point machine!</p>
<p>John: Now we just need to grind until we get enough to escape the void.</p>
<p>Matthew: I have just one question, what do we do afterwards?</p>
<p>John: Good question, we restore together our rein of terror across the entire multiverse!</p>
<p>Matthew: Good plan, I am liking it</p>
